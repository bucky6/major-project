# Proposal

I want to make a text-based choose-your-own-adventure dungeon crawler. The player will have some freedom to do what they want, but it'll be mostly pre-set choices to determine the ending.

## Needs to have list

- At least 3 different endings
- Text input from user
- Sound effects and background music
- Hitpoints and damage
- Starting menu and end screen
- At least 3 different monsters
- Boss

## Nice to have list

- Customizable characters or multiple different ones
- In-game merchant to buy supplies from
- Character abilities levels (strength, intelligence, dexterity, etc)
- Separate mini-game to determine abilities
- Hunger and thirst variables
- Mini-map
- Power-ups
- Log of every event that's occurred (Ex. You hit monster, you drank a potion, monster hit you)
- Different main quests to choose from
- Side quests
- Weapons and other items for player to pick up
- Make text for intro scroll down the screen
- NPC's to interact with
