# Proposal

I want to make a pixelized top-down dungeon crawler, with a choose your own adventure aspect. There'll be a few different set endings, but your choices in the game will affect how it turns out in the end. 

## Needs to have list

- 5-ish different endings
- User text input
- Texture pack from opengameart
- Sound effects and background music
- Abilities levels (strength, intelligence, dexterity, etc)
- Hitpoints and damage
- Starting menu and end screen
- 3 different monsters
- Boss
- NPC's to interact with

## Nice to have list

- Customizable characters or multiple different ones
- In-game merchant to buy supplies from
- Separate mini-game to determine abilities
- Hunger and thirst variables
- Fighting scenes actually affect how the game will turn out-- aren't just pre-determined
- Mini-map
- Power-up
- Separate fighting screens
