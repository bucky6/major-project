# Proposal

I want to make a pixelized top-down choose-your-own-adventure dungeon crawler. The player will have some freedom to do what they want, but it'll be mostly pre-set choices to determine the ending.

## Needs to have list

- 5-ish different endings
- Text input from user
- Texture pack from opengameart
- Sound effects and background music
- Abilities levels (strength, intelligence, dexterity, etc)
- Hitpoints and damage
- Starting menu and end screen
- At least 3 different monsters
- Boss
- NPC's to interact with
- Box at the bottom of screen to display text

## Nice to have list

- Customizable characters or multiple different ones
- In-game merchant to buy supplies from
- Separate mini-game to determine abilities
- Hunger and thirst variables
- Mini-map
- Power-ups
- Separate fighting screens with animations
- Event log (see pixel dungeon)
- Different main quests to choose from
- Side quests
