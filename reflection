If I had any advice for myself starting this project, I would say shoot lower and then make improvements once there's a working finished game.
Making the basics and then perfecting things would have helped me a lot with time management and being able to get done what I wanted to get done. I spent ages
trying to perfect the start screen and by the time I had it how I wanted it I didn't have enough time to code the actual game. I also would have spent more time thinking 
about how to make my code more efficient. If I had still decided to go with a completely text-based game, I would have also not used the text function in Java and
just started off making images in paint.net and then importing them, because text formatting is a huge pain and takes a really long time.
